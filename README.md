This is NumPy Cheat Sheet.

NumPy is an acronym for "Numeric Python" or "Numerical Python". It is an open source extension module for Python, which provides fast precompiled functions for mathematical and numerical routines. Furthermore, NumPy enriches the programming language Python with powerful data structures for efficient computation of multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. The implementation is even aiming at huge matrices and arrays. Besides that the module supplies a large library of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these matrices and arrays.
